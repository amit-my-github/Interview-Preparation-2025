SOLID principles help guide how we design our classes and relationships in object-oriented systems, especially in .NET.
They make the codebase easier to understand, test, and modify without breaking other parts of the system.

Over time, I’ve seen that when teams follow SOLID — especially things like SRP and DIP — it becomes much easier to scale and add new features without rewriting code.

SRP:
The Single Responsibility Principle means a class should have only one reason to change — it should do just one thing.
Following this keeps the code clean, easier to test, and less fragile when requirements change.
For example, in a .NET project, I split a CustomerService class that was doing too much — logic, data access, and emails — into three separate classes. That improved maintainability and reduced side effects when we made changes

OCP:
The Open/Closed Principle says that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification — meaning we should be able to add 
new functionality without changing existing code.
This makes the system more stable, flexible, and less prone to bugs when we add new features. It also promotes reuse and makes testing easier.
For example, in a payment module I worked on, new rules were being added frequently. At first, everything was inside one big class, and every change risked breaking old logic. I applied OCP by refactoring the logic into separate rule classes using the strategy pattern and interfaces. This allowed us to add or replace rules safely without modifying the core workflow.

LSP:
The Liskov Substitution Principle means that derived classes should be able to replace their base classes without changing the behavior of the program.

It helps ensure that your inheritance structure is valid — if a subclass violates the expectations of a base class, it can lead to bugs 
and tightly coupled code. LSP makes systems more reliable and easier to extend.”

In one project, we had a base ReportGenerator class, but one of the derived classes threw exceptions when certain methods were called — breaking the flow when we substituted it in. I refactored the design to use proper interfaces instead, ensuring that only appropriate functionality was inherited. That preserved behavior and improved maintainability.

ISP:
The Interface Segregation Principle says that classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use — it promotes small, focused interfaces instead of large, general ones.
This helps avoid unnecessary dependencies and keeps classes clean, focused, and easier to maintain. It also reduces the risk of breaking unrelated code when interfaces change.

In a reporting system I worked on, we originally had a single IReportService interface with too many responsibilities — some implementations had to include empty methods they didn’t need. I split it into more granular interfaces like IGeneratable and IExportable, so each class only had to implement what was relevant to its function. This improved modularity and made testing much easier.

DIP
The Dependency Inversion Principle means high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules — both should depend on abstractions.
This promotes loose coupling, which makes the system easier to extend, test, and maintain. It allows us to replace or mock dependencies without changing the business logic.

In a .NET Core app, we initially had a controller that directly created a SqlDataService using new, which made testing and swapping out the implementation difficult. I introduced an interface and used constructor injection through the built-in DI container. That way, the controller became loosely coupled, and we could inject mocks in tests or switch to a new service implementation later with zero code change in the controller
