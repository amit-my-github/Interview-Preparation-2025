## ✅ **Revised and Validated Explanation**

### ❓ What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a **software design pattern** used in .NET Core to achieve **loose coupling** between classes and their dependencies.

### 📌 Key Concepts

1. **Dependency**:
   A dependency is any object that a class needs to function properly. For example, if a `Controller` needs a `Repository`, then the `Repository` is a dependency.

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   Instead of creating the dependency inside a class (e.g., via `new`), it is **provided from the outside**, usually by a **DI container**. This promotes better code **modularity, testability, and maintainability**.

3. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**:
   DI is one way to achieve Inversion of Control.
   IoC means **delegating the responsibility of managing object creation** and lifecycle to an external component (like the built-in **IoC container** in .NET Core), instead of hard-coding it inside the classes.

4. **How .NET Core Uses DI**:
   .NET Core has a built-in **IoC container** that automatically injects services registered in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` via constructor injection.

> In .NET Core, **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a software design pattern that promotes loose coupling between classes by injecting required dependencies from the outside, rather than creating them inside the class.

> It is based on the principle of **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, which states that the control of creating and managing dependencies should be transferred from the class itself to an external container or framework.

> .NET Core provides a built-in **IoC container** that supports constructor injection by default, enabling easier testing, maintenance, and flexibility in code.
