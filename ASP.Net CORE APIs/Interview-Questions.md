### **.NET Core Web API Interview Questions**

1. **Stateful vs Stateless Protocols**
2. **What are HTTP Verbs?**
3. **GET vs POST**
4. **PUT vs PATCH**
5. **What is Base Controller Class?**
6. **What are Endpoints?**
7. **What is API Versioning?**
8. **What is Minimal API?**
9. **Content Negotiation**

Content Negotiation in .NET Core Web API is the process where the server selects the appropriate format (e.g., JSON, XML) to return data based on the client's request, typically via the Accept HTTP header

---

> In .NET Core Web API, content negotiation is built-in by default. When a client sends a request with an **Accept header**, the framework automatically selects the best formatter to serialize the response — typically JSON or XML.

> You can enable or disable formatters in the `Startup.cs` by configuring `MvcOptions`. For example, to support XML, you add the XML formatter using `services.AddControllers().AddXmlSerializerFormatters()`.

> This way, the same API endpoint can return different content types based on what the client requests, without extra coding.

10. **What are Return Types?**
11. **Dependency Injection**
Your explanation of **Dependency Injection (DI)** in .NET Core is mostly accurate and well-stated. Here’s a **validated and refined** version with clarifications and minor corrections to improve precision and completeness:

## ✅ **Revised and Validated Explanation**

### ❓ What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a **software design pattern** used in .NET Core to achieve **loose coupling** between classes and their dependencies.

### 📌 Key Concepts

1. **Dependency**:
   A dependency is any object that a class needs to function properly. For example, if a `Controller` needs a `Repository`, then the `Repository` is a dependency.

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   Instead of creating the dependency inside a class (e.g., via `new`), it is **provided from the outside**, usually by a **DI container**. This promotes better code **modularity, testability, and maintainability**.

3. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**:
   DI is one way to achieve Inversion of Control.
   IoC means **delegating the responsibility of managing object creation** and lifecycle to an external component (like the built-in **IoC container** in .NET Core), instead of hard-coding it inside the classes.

4. **How .NET Core Uses DI**:
   .NET Core has a built-in **IoC container** that automatically injects services registered in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` via constructor injection.

> In .NET Core, **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a software design pattern that promotes loose coupling between classes by injecting required dependencies from the outside, rather than creating them inside the class.

> It is based on the principle of **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, which states that the control of creating and managing dependencies should be transferred from the class itself to an external container or framework.

> .NET Core provides a built-in **IoC container** that supports constructor injection by default, enabling easier testing, maintenance, and flexibility in code.

12. **Filters**
---

**"Filters in ASP.NET Core are like checkpoints around your controller actions. They let you run some code before or after your action runs."**

---

**"There are a few types:**

* **Authorization filters:** Check if the user can use the API before doing anything else.
* **Resource filters:** Run early to maybe cache stuff or stop the request fast.
* **Action filters:** Run just before and after your actual action method. Great for logging or changing input/output.
* **Exception filters:** Catch errors so you can handle or log them nicely.
* **Result filters:** Run when the response is being sent back, so you can change headers or tweak the result."\*\*

---

**"You can apply filters globally (for everything), on a whole controller, or just on specific actions. This helps keep your code clean — no need to repeat the same checks or logs everywhere."**

---

**"So basically, filters help you add extra behavior around your actions without cluttering your main code."**
