Design pattern vs Architecture pattern vs Architecture style

### 1. **Design Pattern**
Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common problems that occur in software design. They are not complete solutions by themselves but rather templates that can be adapted to solve specific issues in your software. The key here is that they focus on **how** to solve a specific problem within a specific context. Design patterns deal with individual components and their interaction, mainly on the **class and object level**.

#### Examples:
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer**: Allows a subject to notify its observers about state changes, often used in event-driven systems.
- **Decorator**: Allows behavior to be added to an individual object dynamically.

### 2. **Architecture Pattern**
Architecture patterns are **higher-level structures** and strategies used to solve common architectural problems in system design. These patterns typically focus on **how** various system components are arranged and interact with each other to create scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. They are about organizing your system in such a way that it is robust, scalable, and adaptable.

#### Examples:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Structures a system as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate over a network. Each service is independently deployable and focuses on a single business domain.
- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single, unified system where all components are tightly coupled together.
- **Layered Architecture**: Divides the system into layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access layers, each responsible for specific concerns.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Centers around events and allows components to react to them, typically used in real-time systems.

### 3. **Architecture Style**
An architecture style refers to the **overall structure and approach** for organizing the components and interactions in a software system. It is a set of **design principles and constraints** that guide the organization of the system architecture. Architecture styles are broader than patterns and tend to focus on **philosophical approaches** to solving problems.

#### Examples:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Involves clients that request services and servers that provide those services. It’s one of the most common styles in distributed systems.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Organizes software as a collection of services that communicate over a network, promoting reusability and interoperability.
- **Microkernel Architecture**: Focuses on a core system (the microkernel) that provides minimal functionality, and additional features are added via plug-ins or extensions.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: Decentralized architecture where each node can act as both a client and a server.

### Key Differences:

1. **Level of Abstraction**:
   - **Design Patterns**: Concern individual components, classes, or objects and how they interact within the codebase.
   - **Architecture Patterns**: Focus on the larger structure of the system, how different modules interact, and how the system is organized as a whole.
   - **Architecture Styles**: Provide general principles or philosophies for structuring a system, which often leads to the adoption of specific architecture patterns.

2. **Usage**:
   - **Design Patterns**: Applied in the context of specific coding problems, usually at a low level of the system.
   - **Architecture Patterns**: Applied to solve higher-level design problems and to define the overall system structure and components.
   - **Architecture Styles**: Provide a broad approach to system design, defining the overarching organization of the system.

3. **Granularity**:
   - **Design Patterns**: Typically granular and focus on solving problems within specific parts of the application.
   - **Architecture Patterns**: Typically more comprehensive and deal with the overall design and structure.
   - **Architecture Styles**: Typically the broadest and deal with the overall approach or philosophy for building a system.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine you're designing an e-commerce system.

- **Design Pattern**: You might use the **Factory Pattern** to create different types of payment methods (CreditCard, PayPal, etc.) based on user input, or you might use the **Observer Pattern** to notify various services when an order is placed.
  
- **Architecture Pattern**: You might use the **Microservices Architecture** to split your e-commerce application into services like product catalog, order processing, payment processing, etc., with each service being independently deployable.

- **Architecture Style**: You could choose an **Event-Driven Architecture** as your architecture style, where different services communicate asynchronously by sending events.

### Tips for System Design Interview Preparation:
- **Understand scalability**: Know how to design systems that can scale (horizontally or vertically), and how to partition and distribute data.
- **Understand fault tolerance**: Know how to design systems that remain functional even when some parts fail.
- **Understand trade-offs**: Every architecture decision has trade-offs. Be ready to explain the pros and cons of different approaches (e.g., monolithic vs. microservices, SQL vs. NoSQL).
- **Be clear with communication**: Break down your designs clearly and discuss your assumptions. Interviewers care about how you approach problems, your reasoning, and your thought process.
- **Practice**: Sketch out system designs for real-world scenarios and be ready to discuss how you would approach building them.

I completely understand! System design interviews can definitely feel overwhelming due to the sheer volume of concepts you need to remember and communicate clearly. But the good news is, with a structured approach and some practice, you can tackle these challenges with confidence.

Here are some strategies to help make it easier to remember and explain things during interviews:

### 1. **Break Down the Problem**
When you're given a system design problem in an interview, the first thing you should do is **clarify** and **break down the requirements**. This helps you approach the problem step-by-step, which will reduce the pressure. For example:
- **Understand the functional requirements** (what needs to be built).
- **Understand the non-functional requirements** (scalability, reliability, performance).
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear about the scope or constraints.

This helps you know what kind of design patterns, architecture styles, or patterns you need to use in the solution. It also helps in narrowing down which concepts are relevant to the system.

### 2. **Follow a Structured Design Process**
System design problems can be approached methodically. Here’s a simplified process that you can use during interviews:
   - **Step 1: Requirements Gathering** – Ask questions to make sure you understand both functional and non-functional requirements.
   - **Step 2: High-Level Design** – Lay out the big picture, draw the system architecture, and decide how the components interact with each other.
   - **Step 3: Break Down Components** – Dive deeper into the components, services, databases, or technologies you’ll use.
   - **Step 4: Consider Scalability and Fault Tolerance** – Think about how to handle increasing load and how your system would respond to failures.
   - **Step 5: Trade-offs** – Discuss the trade-offs you made (e.g., monolithic vs. microservices, SQL vs. NoSQL) and explain why you chose the specific solution.
   - **Step 6: Final Refinement** – Bring everything together, considering optimization (latency, throughput, consistency), and conclude by summarizing your design.

By sticking to this process, you can guide yourself through the complexity of the problem without feeling lost or overwhelmed.

### 3. **Use Visual Aids (Draw Diagrams)**
Don’t hesitate to **sketch out diagrams**. A well-drawn diagram can communicate your thoughts far more effectively than words alone. You can use components like:
   - **Databases** (SQL/NoSQL)
   - **APIs/Services** (how different parts of the system communicate)
   - **Load balancers**
   - **Queues for async processing**
   - **Microservices or monolithic architectures**
   - **CDNs and Caching layers**

Drawing helps to **visualize the architecture** and will also help you organize your thoughts. It can be a great tool when you're explaining complex concepts in interviews.

### 4. **Understand Trade-offs**
It’s important to know that **there’s no one-size-fits-all solution** in system design. Each design decision you make will have its pros and cons. During the interview, be sure to explain why you chose a particular approach and the trade-offs involved. For example:
   - **Monolithic vs. Microservices**: Microservices offer scalability but come with the complexity of managing multiple services. Monolithic apps are simpler but harder to scale in certain scenarios.
   - **SQL vs. NoSQL**: NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability for large datasets, but SQL databases ensure data integrity with ACID properties.

Being able to discuss trade-offs will show the interviewer that you’re thinking critically about the design and its implications.

### 5. **Master Core Concepts & Patterns**
While there’s a lot to remember, there are a few core concepts and patterns that pop up frequently in system design interviews. If you **internalize** these, you can adapt to different scenarios more easily:
   - **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling, sticky sessions, and algorithms like round-robin.
   - **Caching**: Use cases for caching, strategies (LRU, LFU), and tools like Redis.
   - **Database Sharding**: How to break down a large database into smaller, manageable pieces.
   - **Event-Driven Architecture**: When to use asynchronous messaging and queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
   - **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance – and how it affects your system design.

### 6. **Practice, Practice, Practice**
The best way to internalize these concepts and make them second nature is by practicing frequently. Here’s how:
   - **Mock Interviews**: Do as many mock interviews as possible with peers or platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io, or even by recording yourself.
   - **Design Systems**: Try to design common systems like a URL shortener, an online bookstore, a social media platform, or an e-commerce site. The more you practice designing, the more comfortable you'll be in an actual interview.
   - **Review Real-World Systems**: Study the architecture of well-known systems like **YouTube**, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **Netflix**. You’ll start to see patterns and common practices.

### 7. **Explain as You Go**
Even if you feel nervous, don’t hesitate to **talk through your thought process** during the interview. The interviewer is interested in seeing how you approach problems, not just the final answer. As you walk through your design, explaining why you're making certain decisions helps show your problem-solving skills.

### 8. **Be Comfortable with Trade-offs and Unknowns**
It's okay to not know everything. In fact, interviewers often want to see how you deal with uncertainty. If you're stuck on something, it's fine to say, "I'm not entirely sure about this, but here’s what I would try..." This shows that you can think critically and are comfortable making decisions even when information isn't fully available.

### Final Thought:
You’re not expected to remember everything or have a perfect solution. The key is to **show your problem-solving process, communicate clearly**, and demonstrate your understanding of the trade-offs and decisions involved. With regular practice and a structured approach, you'll feel much more confident in your system design interviews.
