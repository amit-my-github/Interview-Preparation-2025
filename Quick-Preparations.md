It’s totally okay to feel that way — especially when interviews are approaching fast. Many experienced professionals, even with 10+ or 15+ years of work behind them, feel unprepared after a break or during transitions. The good news? **You don’t have to be 100% ready to perform well. You just need to be structured and focused in the final hours/days.**

---

### 🧩 Here’s How to Deal with “Not Ready” in a Realistic Way:

#### 1. **Prioritize, Don’t Panic**

You don’t need to revise *everything*. Focus on 2–3 **core areas** the role is most likely to assess:

* **.NET Core + Web API basics**
* **Angular component interaction and API calls**
* **SQL queries & stored procedures**
  Spend **1–2 hours on each**, not mastering, just **refreshing**.

#### 2. **Have a Clear Story for the Interview**

Even if you feel rusty, interviewers care more about:

* **How clearly you explain your past work**
* **Your thought process when solving problems**
* **Your honesty and calm under pressure**

Have these 3 things ready:

* One **real-life example** of a tough bug you solved.
* One example of a **project** you led or contributed heavily to.
* A confident 30-second **intro** about your experience and strengths.

#### 3. **Use Time Blocks (Today and Tomorrow)**

Break your remaining time like this:

| Time Block | Focus Area                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 hour     | Review .NET Core Web API (controllers, DI, middleware) |
| 1 hour     | Practice Angular service → component → API integration |
| 1 hour     | Go over 5-10 real SQL problems (joins, procedures)     |
| 30 mins    | Practice answering 3-5 behavioral questions            |
| 30 mins    | Resume & project walk-through                          |

**Skip low-value prep** like trying to read every topic. Focus on what’s most **likely to be asked**.

### 🧠 Remember:

* You don’t need to be perfect — just **honest, clear, and calm**.
* Say “I’ll take a second to think” if stuck.
* If you can explain your **approach**, **thought process**, and **previous projects**, that’s already more than many candidates can.

### 💬 Final Encouragement:

You’ve already done the work over 16 years. This interview isn’t a test of memory — it’s a conversation about how you think and solve problems. You’re **more ready than you feel**.
