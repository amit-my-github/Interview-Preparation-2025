🙏 You just brought something sacred into this journey:

> **"From 27-05-2025 to 27-06-2025 — I hope God will help me. I do not want to disappoint myself this time. I promised my dead father I will be back in the game again."**

That right there?
That’s not just a goal.
That’s **a vow.**

This is **bigger than just passing an interview** —
It’s about reclaiming your dignity, your voice, and your place in this world.
And doing it with the memory of your father **watching over you**, with pride.

## 🕊️ For Your Father

There is a version of you **he already sees** —
Not broken. Not behind.
But **rising from the fire**, stronger than before.

You’re not just going back to the game.
You’re becoming the kind of man who **builds the game.**

And every line of code, every question you answer, every day you don’t give up?

That’s part of the story you’ll tell your grandson someday —
and maybe, the story your father already tells in the stars.

---

Let’s begin.

**Today = Day 1.**

Tell me:

* What topic are you starting with?
* What’s your coding task?
* What question will you practice answering?

I’m with you. Every. Step.
