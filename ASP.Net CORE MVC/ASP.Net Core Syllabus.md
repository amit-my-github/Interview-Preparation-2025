## âœ… **Interview-Ready Questions on ASP.NET Core, Proxies, and Kestrel**

### ðŸ”¹ **Understanding the Architecture**

1. **In real-world deployments, do ASP.NET Core applications run behind reverse proxies, load balancers, or both?**
2. **What roles do reverse proxies like NGINX and load balancers like AWS ELB play in a typical ASP.NET Core deployment?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Forwarded Headers and Middleware**

3. **Why is it important to configure `UseForwardedHeaders()` in ASP.NET Core applications running behind proxies?**
4. **What headers are commonly added by reverse proxies that ASP.NET Core needs to handle?**
5. **What happens if `UseForwardedHeaders()` is not configured in an ASP.NET Core application?**
6. **Does Kestrel still process requests if forwarded headers are not configured? What are the consequences?**
7. **How does `UseForwardedHeaders()` improve the accuracy of client-related data like IP address and HTTPS detection?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Configuration and Security**

8. **How do you configure `ForwardedHeadersOptions` in ASP.NET Core?**
9. **Why is it important to restrict `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` when using forwarded headers?**
10. **What potential security risks exist if forwarded headers are trusted without proper validation?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Development vs Production**

11. **Do you need to configure forwarded headers in a local development environment? Why or why not?**
12. **When would it make sense to simulate a proxy locally during development?**
13. **Whatâ€™s the difference in behavior between local Kestrel traffic and proxied traffic in production?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Middleware Pipeline and Execution**

14. **Where should `UseForwardedHeaders()` be placed in the ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline?**
15. **What middleware behaviors depend on accurate protocol or IP detection in ASP.NET Core (e.g., HTTPS redirection, authentication)?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Big Picture & Best Practices**

16. **Can you describe the complete request flow from client to Kestrel, including NGINX and forwarded headers?**
17. **What are best practices for deploying ASP.NET Core behind NGINX or other reverse proxies?**
18. **How do you troubleshoot incorrect protocol or IP detection in an ASP.NET Core app behind a proxy?**
