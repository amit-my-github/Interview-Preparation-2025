In ASP.NET Core, several middleware behaviors **depend on accurate protocol (HTTP vs. HTTPS) or IP detection** to function correctly. This is especially important when your app is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, such as NGINX, IIS, or Azure Application Gateway, which might obscure the actual client IP or protocol. Below are the main middleware and features affected:

---

### 1. **HTTPS Redirection Middleware**

* **Depends on:** Accurate protocol detection.
* **Behavior:** Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
* **Issue:** If the proxy terminates SSL but doesn’t forward the original scheme correctly (via `X-Forwarded-Proto`), this middleware might not detect that the original request was HTTPS and cause an infinite redirect loop.

---

### 2. **HSTS Middleware (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**

* **Depends on:** Accurate protocol detection.
* **Behavior:** Adds HSTS headers to HTTPS responses.
* **Issue:** If HTTPS isn’t accurately detected, HSTS headers won’t be sent when appropriate.

---

### 3. **Request Filtering and Authorization**

* **Depends on:** Accurate client IP detection.
* **Behavior:** Some apps use IP allow/deny lists or geo-blocking.
* **Issue:** If the real client IP isn’t forwarded via headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, the logic may block or allow the wrong users.

---

### 4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**

* **Depends on:** Accurate client IP detection.
* **Behavior:** Tracks request rates per IP.
* **Issue:** Inaccurate IP detection may allow abuse or incorrectly throttle users behind the same proxy.

---

### 5. **Logging and Diagnostics**

* **Depends on:** Accurate IP and protocol detection.
* **Behavior:** Logging request details, such as IP and scheme.
* **Issue:** Misleading logs hinder troubleshooting and auditing.

---

### 6. **Cookie Policy Middleware**

* **Depends on:** Protocol detection.
* **Behavior:** Configures cookie `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes based on HTTPS.
* **Issue:** Cookies might be flagged insecure or not behave properly on modern browsers.

---

### 7. **Routing and URL Generation**

* **Depends on:** Protocol and sometimes host detection.
* **Behavior:** `UrlHelper` and similar APIs generate absolute URLs.
* **Issue:** URLs may use `http://` instead of `https://`, or incorrect hostnames if headers like `X-Forwarded-Host` are not forwarded.

---

### Mitigation: `ForwardedHeadersMiddleware`

To address this, ASP.NET Core provides the **`ForwardedHeadersMiddleware`**, which must be configured properly:

```csharp
app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions
{
    ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto,
    // Optionally:
    // KnownProxies, KnownNetworks, or RequireHeaderSymmetry for extra security
});
```

This middleware **must be registered early** in the middleware pipeline (typically before authentication, routing, and anything relying on IP/scheme).

| Middleware / Feature         | Depends On      | Risk If Misconfigured        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| HTTPS Redirection            | Protocol        | Redirect loops               |
| HSTS                         | Protocol        | No HSTS headers sent         |
| IP Filtering / Authorization | IP              | Incorrect access control     |
| Rate Limiting                | IP              | Abuse or unfair throttling   |
| Logging                      | IP & Protocol   | Misleading diagnostics       |
| Cookie Security Policies     | Protocol        | Insecure or rejected cookies |
| URL Generation               | Protocol & Host | Incorrect absolute URLs      |

Let me know if you'd like code samples or guidance for a specific middleware.

Troubleshooting incorrect protocol or IP detection in an **ASP.NET Core app behind a reverse proxy** (like NGINX, IIS, or Azure Front Door) involves validating your middleware setup, proxy headers, and network configuration. Here's a structured guide to troubleshoot the problem:

---

## 🔍 1. **Check for `UseForwardedHeaders` Middleware**

Ensure you're using the `ForwardedHeadersMiddleware` early in the pipeline:

```csharp
app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions
{
    ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto
});
```

> ✅ This must come **before any middleware** that relies on IP or scheme detection, like HTTPS redirection, HSTS, authentication, etc.

---

## 🔧 2. **Enable Header Forwarding Logs**

Enable detailed logging to check what headers the app is receiving:

### appsettings.Development.json:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides": "Debug"
    }
  }
}
```

This will log the parsing and application of `X-Forwarded-*` headers.

---

## 🌐 3. **Inspect Incoming Headers**

Check actual headers being sent by your proxy using tools like:

* **Browser DevTools** (Inspect → Network tab)
* **Curl or Postman**
* **ASP.NET Core middleware or logging**:

  ```csharp
  app.Use(async (context, next) =>
  {
      Console.WriteLine($"Scheme: {context.Request.Scheme}");
      Console.WriteLine($"Remote IP: {context.Connection.RemoteIpAddress}");
      Console.WriteLine($"Headers: {string.Join(", ", context.Request.Headers.Select(h => $"{h.Key}={h.Value}"))}");
      await next();
  });
  ```

> You're looking for headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and possibly `X-Forwarded-Host`.

---

## ⚙️ 4. **Configure Trusted Proxies or Networks**

By default, `ForwardedHeadersMiddleware` **ignores forwarded headers unless they come from trusted sources**. You must specify known proxies or networks:

### Example:

```csharp
options.KnownProxies.Add(IPAddress.Parse("192.168.1.10"));
```

Or for development/testing:

```csharp
options.KnownNetworks.Clear();
options.KnownProxies.Clear();
options.ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.All;
options.AllowForwardedHeaders = true; // (as of .NET 8+)
```

> ⚠️ Be **careful** in production — blindly trusting all forwarded headers is a **security risk**.

---

## 🧪 5. **Verify Proxy Configuration**

Make sure your proxy (NGINX, IIS, etc.) is **sending** the correct headers:

### NGINX Example:

```nginx
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
```

### IIS (via ANCM):

* Set up **ARR (Application Request Routing)** to forward the headers.
* Enable `UseProxy` settings.
* Or use **IIS Integration** in ASP.NET Core, which handles it automatically for most setups.

---

## 🧪 6. **Test in a Controlled Setup**

To isolate the issue:

* Run your ASP.NET Core app **locally** without a proxy and check protocol/IP behavior.
* Use a local proxy like **NGINX or Caddy** and simulate requests with/without `X-Forwarded-*`.

---

## ✅ 7. **Verify Results**

After fixing, verify:

* `HttpContext.Request.Scheme` reflects `https`
* `HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress` matches the original client
* Middleware like HTTPS redirection, rate limiting, or IP restrictions behaves as expected
