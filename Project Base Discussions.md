"A legal thesaurus is essentially a specialized tool or database that helps to find synonyms or related terms within the legal field. It's designed to provide alternative words or phrases that are used in legal documents, statutes, case law, and other legal texts. This is really helpful because legal language can be complex, and sometimes different terms are used to describe similar concepts.

For example, a legal thesaurus might show that 'contract' and 'agreement' are related terms, or that 'plaintiff' and 'complainant' might be used interchangeably in certain contexts. By using a legal thesaurus, a legal professional can ensure that they are considering all relevant terms and can make sure they’re using the most precise language in their work, especially when dealing with legal searches or preparing legal documents."

Legal Intelligence is the legal search engine for professionals:
Searching in a super-fast legal search engine has never been easier. Legal Intelligence has been the content integration platform and the intelligent search engine for legal and fiscal content for over 20 years. Want to experience what Legal Intelligence can do for you?

Why Legal Intelligence?
As a legal and fiscal professional, you want to find the right information to substantiate your case in a short time. Stop looking for a needle in the proverbial haystack to find the right and relevant sources within the legal domain. The legal search engine of Legal Intelligence offers the possibility to search in one placewithin judgments, public sources, professional journals, books and commentaries of 25 legal publishers. Are you curious about the power of Legal Intelligence?

Smart search and the best legal thesaurus:
Our carefully constructed legal thesaurus forms the basis of Legal Intelligence. The quality of this thesaurus is further improved by intelligent algorithms and rankings within Legal Intelligence. This makes the unlocking of legal content very accurate and you can find the information that is relevant to you even better.

With the advanced search options and functionalities within Legal Intelligence, you can search smartly and extensively and find the information you are looking for in the blink of an eye.

Legal Intelligence Introduction

Project overview: Legal Intelligence, 25+ publishers, legal search
My role: Frontend — ASP.NET, MVC 5, Web API
Collaboration with backend (Solr/Java team)
Key features: Alerts, dossiers, LI Library
Achievements: Awards, client visits, Innovation Camp
Learnings: Scalable UI, domain understanding
Challenges: Performance, UX complexity, cross-team work

I’d like to share a quick insight into a project I’ve been deeply involved in for over 12 years — *Legal Intelligence*.

It’s a legal search platform designed to give professionals fast, intelligent access to legal and fiscal content. We brought together data from over 25 publishers, including big names like Wolters Kluwer and Sdu, and made it all easily searchable through a smart, user-friendly interface.

I was part of the **frontend team**, where I worked with technologies like **ASP.NET, MVC 5, Web API**, and **SQL Server** to design and build the application’s core user experience. A key part of my role was making sure the platform remained fast, intuitive, and responsive — even as the content and user base scaled up. I also collaborated closely with our **search and indexing teams**, who handled backend content processing in **Java and Solr**, to ensure the frontend integrated seamlessly with the intelligent search capabilities.

The platform also includes features like personalized alerts, dossiers, collaboration tools, and add-ons like the LI Library, which supports full-text searches across legal books and integrates with library systems.

Over the years, I had the chance to visit client sites twice — in 2019 and 2022 — for on-site collaboration and implementation, which helped strengthen relationships and ensure the solution met real-world needs. I also got to participate in Wolters Kluwer’s Innovation Camp in the Netherlands — a great experience to exchange ideas and explore new possibilities.

Our team was honored with Best Team Awards in both 2017 and 2024, and I received recognition in 2015 for leading the successful architecture revamp, along with a CMD R&R award for commitment and contribution to the project.

It’s been an amazing journey, and I’m proud of the impact we’ve made in the legal tech space.

What is my learning in this project and challenges you have faced?

Working on *Legal Intelligence* over 12 years taught me a lot — not just technically, but also in terms of collaboration, adaptability, and understanding domain-driven development.

**From a technical perspective**, I deepened my expertise in **ASP.NET, MVC, Web APIs, and integrating complex search systems like Solr** on the frontend. Since legal content is highly structured and search-heavy, I learned how to design UI and user experiences that balance performance with clarity — making advanced search functionality accessible to non-technical users.

One of the biggest **challenges** was maintaining **performance and usability** as the platform scaled — especially with growing content from 25+ publishers and more complex user needs. Integrating with constantly evolving backend systems, while ensuring the frontend stayed stable, fast, and intuitive, pushed me to think more proactively about design patterns and modular architecture.

Another key challenge was **keeping up with legal domain knowledge** — it's not a space where you can just rely on generic design. I had to learn how legal professionals think and work so we could translate that into smart, practical UI features like dossiers, alerts, and content categorization.

On the **soft skills side**, working with cross-functional teams — and especially visiting clients on-site — helped me grow in communication, requirement gathering, and thinking from the user’s perspective. Those visits in 2019 and 2022 were eye-opening — understanding how users actually work made a huge difference in how we built features.

Overall, the project taught me the value of long-term thinking — building systems that can evolve, scale, and stay relevant, while still being user-centric.
