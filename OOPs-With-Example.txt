### 1. **Encapsulation**

**What it is:**
Encapsulation is the concept of *bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit*. It’s like putting the details of a process into a black box so that the user doesn’t need to worry about how the process happens, only what the inputs and outputs are.

---

**Example in an ASP.NET Core Library:**

Let's say we’re creating a library to handle some **user validation**. We’ll use **Encapsulation** to bundle the validation logic and user data in one class.

```csharp
// A class that encapsulates user data and validation logic
public class User
{
    private string _email;
    private string _password;

    // Public property to get and set the email
    public string Email
    {
        get { return _email; }
        set
        {
            // Add logic to validate email format
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) || !value.Contains('@'))
                throw new ArgumentException("Invalid email format.");
            _email = value;
        }
    }

    // Public method to validate password strength
    public bool IsValidPassword(string password)
    {
        return password.Length >= 8;
    }
}
```

**Explanation (Feynman Technique):**
- The `User` class **encapsulates** both data (`_email`, `_password`) and functionality (e.g., email validation).
- The **internal details** of the validation logic are hidden from the outside world. The user of the `User` class doesn't need to know how email validation works; they just need to know that they can **set** and **get** the email with validation.
- **Encapsulation** helps maintain **control** over how the data is accessed and modified.

### 2. **Abstraction**

**What it is:**
Abstraction allows us to **hide complex implementation details** and expose only the necessary parts. It’s like how a TV remote lets you control a TV without knowing how the TV’s internal circuits work.

---

**Example in an ASP.NET Core Library:**

Let’s create an **IUserService** interface that defines actions related to user management. We’ll then create a **concrete implementation** for the service that hides the details of how user data is stored (e.g., in-memory or a database).

```csharp
// IUserService is an abstraction of user-related operations
public interface IUserService
{
    Task<bool> RegisterUserAsync(string email, string password);
    Task<User> GetUserAsync(string email);
}

// Concrete implementation of IUserService
public class UserService : IUserService
{
    private readonly List<User> _users = new List<User>();

    public async Task<bool> RegisterUserAsync(string email, string password)
    {
        // Here, we abstract away the complex logic of user registration.
        var user = new User { Email = email };
        if (!user.IsValidPassword(password))
            return false;
        
        _users.Add(user);
        return true;
    }

    public async Task<User> GetUserAsync(string email)
    {
        return _users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Email == email);
    }
}
```

**Explanation (Feynman Technique):**
- **Abstraction** is achieved by **defining** what actions can be done (registering users, retrieving users) through the `IUserService` interface, but not specifying how these actions are carried out.
- The `UserService` class implements the **interface** and hides the **details** of user registration (e.g., in-memory list). Users of `IUserService` don’t need to know how users are stored—they just need to know they can **register** and **retrieve** users.

---

### 3. **Inheritance**

**What it is:**
Inheritance allows a class to **inherit** properties and behaviors (methods) from another class. It’s like how a **child** inherits characteristics from its **parent** but can also have unique characteristics.

---

**Example in an ASP.NET Core Library:**

Let’s say we want to create a **base class** for different types of notifications (`EmailNotification`, `SmsNotification`), but both share common behavior like sending a message.

```csharp
// Base class for notification
public abstract class Notification
{
    public string Message { get; set; }
    public abstract void Send();
}

// Derived class for Email Notification
public class EmailNotification : Notification
{
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }

    public override void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending Email to {EmailAddress}: {Message}");
    }
}

// Derived class for SMS Notification
public class SmsNotification : Notification
{
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }

    public override void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending SMS to {PhoneNumber}: {Message}");
    }
}
```

**Explanation (Feynman Technique):**
- The `Notification` class defines **common properties** (`Message`) and **behavior** (`Send()`).
- **Inheritance** allows us to create specific types of notifications (like `EmailNotification` or `SmsNotification`) that **inherit** from the base class `Notification` and **override** the `Send()` method to handle the specifics of each type of notification.
- This reduces duplication, allowing us to have **common behavior** in one place and then **specialized behavior** in the derived classes.

---

### 4. **Polymorphism**

**What it is:**
Polymorphism allows us to **use the same method** or **interface** in different ways. It’s like a *"one-size-fits-all"* remote control: it can control different devices, but each device reacts differently to the same button press.

---

**Example in an ASP.NET Core Library:**

Let’s use **polymorphism** to send different types of notifications (email, SMS) using the same method (`SendNotification`), without worrying about which specific type of notification is being sent.

```csharp
public class NotificationService
{
    public void SendNotification(Notification notification)
    {
        notification.Send();  // Calls the appropriate Send method based on the object type
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
var emailNotification = new EmailNotification { EmailAddress = "test@example.com", Message = "Welcome!" };
var smsNotification = new SmsNotification { PhoneNumber = "123456789", Message = "You have a new message!" };

var notificationService = new NotificationService();
notificationService.SendNotification(emailNotification);  // Will call EmailNotification.Send()
notificationService.SendNotification(smsNotification);   // Will call SmsNotification.Send()
```

**Explanation (Feynman Technique):**
- Even though we are using **the same method** (`SendNotification`), the actual behavior of the `Send()` method depends on the **type of object** passed in (either `EmailNotification` or `SmsNotification`).
- This is **polymorphism**—the same method call behaves differently depending on the object type.
- We can **easily extend** our system by adding more notification types (e.g., `PushNotification`), and as long as they inherit from `Notification`, they can be used seamlessly with `SendNotification`.

---

### Conclusion

Here’s how the four pillars of OOP are applied in an **ASP.NET Core Library**:

1. **Encapsulation**: We bundle user data and validation logic inside the `User` class, controlling access to its properties through public methods and properties.
2. **Abstraction**: We define an interface (`IUserService`) to represent user-related operations, hiding the implementation details in `UserService`.
3. **Inheritance**: We use a `Notification` base class, and `EmailNotification` and `SmsNotification` inherit from it to share common behavior but add specific logic.
4. **Polymorphism**: We use the same method (`SendNotification`) to send different types of notifications (`EmailNotification`, `SmsNotification`), allowing for flexible, reusable code.

This approach not only keeps the code clean and modular but also makes it easy to extend in a scalable way, perfect for any **ASP.NET Core application** using a **class library**.
