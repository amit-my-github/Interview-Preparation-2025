Great! Since you’re already familiar with **Entity Framework (EF)**, transitioning to **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** will be smoother for you, as EF Core builds on the concepts of EF but introduces **many improvements and changes**. Here’s a detailed comparison and key differences to help you understand **what’s new** and **what’s different** in EF Core.

### **Key Differences Between EF and EF Core**

---

### **1. Cross-Platform Support**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: **Only supports .NET Framework**. It works with Windows applications and ASP.NET applications built on the full .NET Framework.
- **EF Core**: **Cross-platform**. It supports **.NET Core**, **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, making it suitable for modern, cross-platform applications. It also works with **ASP.NET Core** and can be used in **cloud-based or containerized environments**.

### **2. Lightweight and Modular**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 is a monolithic framework, meaning it comes with a lot of built-in features, even if you don’t need them all.
- **EF Core**: EF Core is designed to be **lighter** and **more modular**. You can choose only the parts you need, which can result in a more efficient application. EF Core uses **NuGet packages** to add specific functionality (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).

### **3. LINQ Provider Improvements**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 provided a **less efficient LINQ provider**, which could sometimes lead to suboptimal queries being executed.
- **EF Core**: EF Core has **significantly improved the LINQ provider**. It translates LINQ queries into SQL more effectively, leading to **better performance** and **more efficient SQL generation**.

### **4. Database Providers**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 primarily supports **SQL Server** and **SQLite**.
- **EF Core**: EF Core offers **broader support** for different databases and is more flexible in supporting various **database providers** out of the box, including:
  - SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and **many others** (e.g., **Oracle**, **Cosmos DB**, **MongoDB** through community providers).

### **5. Migrations**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 provides migrations for database schema changes, but the process could be a bit more rigid and sometimes harder to customize.
- **EF Core**: **EF Core migrations** are more flexible and provide better **customization** for schema changes. You can customize the migration process, make changes to the schema with better support for **data seeding**, **complex schema changes**, and **rollbacks**.

### **6. Support for NoSQL (e.g., Cosmos DB)**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 is **primarily focused on relational databases**.
- **EF Core**: EF Core introduced support for NoSQL databases, such as **Azure Cosmos DB** (a NoSQL database). You can work with both relational and NoSQL data models in the same framework, providing more flexibility.

### **7. Change Tracking**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 has **automatic change tracking** that tracks every property of an entity for changes. However, it can be **resource-intensive** and slower, especially for large models.
- **EF Core**: EF Core provides **more efficient change tracking**, including the ability to opt for **no-tracking queries** (e.g., `AsNoTracking()`), which improves performance when reading data without needing to track changes.

### **8. Querying Enhancements**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 supported **eager loading**, **lazy loading**, and **explicit loading** but had limited optimization.
- **EF Core**: EF Core includes better support for **eager loading** and **lazy loading**. Lazy loading is **enabled by default**, which allows for automatic loading of related entities when accessed. It also allows for **compiled queries** for even better performance and reusability.

### **9. Shadow Properties**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 didn’t natively support **shadow properties** (properties that don’t exist in the entity class but are part of the model).
- **EF Core**: EF Core supports **shadow properties**, meaning you can add properties that are not part of your entity class but are part of the underlying model. This is useful for things like **audit fields** (e.g., `CreatedDate`, `ModifiedBy`).

### **10. Performance Improvements**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 was often criticized for being slow, particularly for large applications with complex models.
- **EF Core**: EF Core has been designed to be **faster** and **more efficient**. It uses **a more efficient query translation system** and has improvements in **memory management** and **change tracking**, which results in better overall performance.

### **11. Support for Value Conversions**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 didn’t have built-in support for **value conversions** (converting between data types).
- **EF Core**: EF Core supports **value conversions**, allowing you to convert between types in the database and types in your code (e.g., converting `DateTime` to `string` in the database).

### **12. Concurrency Handling**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 provided **optimistic concurrency** control but could be a bit more manual when it comes to handling concurrency conflicts.
- **EF Core**: EF Core provides **enhanced concurrency control** features, allowing you to easily work with **row versioning** and detect and resolve concurrency conflicts in a more efficient manner.

### **13. Global Query Filters**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 doesn’t natively support **global query filters**.
- **EF Core**: EF Core allows you to define **global query filters** that apply across all queries for a given entity type. For example, you could add a filter to always exclude **soft-deleted** records or **filter by tenant** in multi-tenant applications.

### **14. Database Initialization**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 had its own **database initializer** strategies for seeding data and ensuring the database was created.
- **EF Core**: EF Core uses a more flexible approach for database initialization. You can use **`EnsureCreated()`** or **`Migrate()`** for setting up the database schema and seeding data.

### **15. Compatibility with .NET**:
- **EF (Entity Framework 6)**: EF 6 works with **.NET Framework**.
- **EF Core**: EF Core works with **.NET Core** and **.NET 5+**, making it more compatible with modern, cross-platform applications.

### **Key Features Added in EF Core (Not in EF 6)**:

1. **In-Memory Database Provider**: EF Core has a built-in **in-memory database provider**, which is useful for unit testing or simple applications that don’t require a real database.
  
2. **Batch Operations**: EF Core supports **batch operations** for certain database providers, which can reduce the number of database round trips and improve performance.

3. **Temporary Tables**: In EF Core, you can use **temporary tables** in your queries, which allows for more advanced database scenarios.

4. **GroupBy in LINQ**: EF Core supports more advanced **GroupBy** operations in LINQ that are executed on the server side, improving performance in certain scenarios.

### **When to Use EF Core vs EF 6**?

- **EF Core**: It’s the future of **Entity Framework** and the recommended choice for new applications. Use EF Core if:
  - You are building a **cross-platform application** or using **.NET Core**.
  - You need **improved performance**, **scalability**, or **cross-database support**.
  - You are working with newer versions of **.NET** and need the latest features (e.g., **global query filters**, **value conversions**).

- **EF 6**: EF 6 is still supported and might be suitable for legacy applications that are built on **.NET Framework**. Use EF 6 if:
  - Your application is still using **.NET Framework** and you don’t plan to upgrade to **.NET Core** or **.NET 5+**.
  - You have an existing codebase in EF 6 and prefer not to migrate at the moment.

---

### **Conclusion**:
While **EF Core** builds on the foundation of **EF**, it offers **many improvements** in terms of **performance**, **flexibility**, **cross-platform support**, and **features** (like **no-SQL support**, **value conversions**, **better migration handling**, etc.). If you are developing new projects or upgrading an old one, it's generally a good idea to use **EF Core** unless you are dealing with a legacy **.NET Framework** application.
