## Understand the difference between `Transient`, `Scoped`, and `Singleton` lifetimes in dependency injection in simple way 

## 🧠 Mental Models

### 🍕 Scoped = One pizza per request 🍕

> Everyone in a request eats from the same pizza. Next request? New pizza!

### 🍔 Transient = New burger every time 🍔

> Every time you ask, they grill a new burger. Even in the same order, it’s fresh again!

---

## 🔄 Your Code (recap)

```csharp
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _service1;
    private readonly IMyService _service2;

    public MyController(IMyService service1, IMyService service2)
    {
        _service1 = service1;
        _service2 = service2;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        bool same = ReferenceEquals(_service1, _service2);
        return Content("Same instance? " + same);
    }
}
```

You're asking:
**Are `_service1` and `_service2` the same instance?**

---

## 🍕 Scoped = One Pizza Per Order

### Analogy:

* You're at a restaurant.
* One order = One HTTP request.
* You and your friend (\_service1 and \_service2) **share the same pizza**.
* Everyone in your party eats from the same pizza box during the same order.
* Next customer (new request) gets a **different pizza**, but your group always shares **one**.

### In Code (Scoped):

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
```

**Output:** `"Same instance? True"`

✅ Because both `_service1` and `_service2` **share the same pizza** for this one order.

---

## 🍔 Transient = New Burger Every Time

### Analogy:

* You're at a fast food place.
* Every time someone orders a burger (asks for a service), they **grill a new one**.
* Even if you're still standing at the counter (same request), asking twice means **two burgers**.

### In Code (Transient):

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
```

**Output:** `"Same instance? False"`

🚨 Because `_service1` and `_service2` each got **their own burger** — freshly made.

---

## 🎯 How This Helps You Remember

| Lifetime      | Analogy                  | Multiple injections in one controller | New instance each request? | New instance each injection? |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Scoped**    | 🍕 One Pizza Per Order   | ❌ No — same pizza shared              | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                         |
| **Transient** | 🍔 New Burger Every Time | ✅ Yes — always a fresh burger         | ✅ Yes                      | ✅ Yes                        |

---

## 💬 So, in your controller:

* **With Scoped**: `_service1` and `_service2` **share the same pizza**.
* **With Transient**: `_service1` and `_service2` **get their own burger**.

This analogy locks in the concept. Next time you think **“should I share a pizza or grill a burger each time?”**, you’ll know the right DI lifetime to use.

---
Absolutely — this confusion is **very common**, and it's good you're asking! Let’s **break down** the difference between **Transient** and **Scoped** in **real-world terms**, especially for **ASP.NET Core or MVC/Web API apps**.

---

## ✅ The Core Idea (High-Level)

| Lifetime      | New Instance When?            | Shared Within?                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Transient** | Every time it's **requested** | Never — always a **fresh** instance |
| **Scoped**    | Once per **HTTP request**     | Shared **within that request**      |

---

## 🧪 Visual Explanation

Let’s use a simple example:

Imagine you're handling **two HTTP requests** to your ASP.NET Web API.

### 🟢 Scoped:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
```

* ✅ Request A: `MyService` instance created ➝ used **throughout that request**.
* ✅ Request B: A **new** instance is created ➝ **independent** of Request A.

🔁 But **inside one request**, multiple classes using `IMyService` get the **same instance**.

---

### 🔴 Transient:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
```

* 🚨 **Every class or call** that requests `IMyService` gets a **brand new object**.
* Even **within the same HTTP request**, you'll get **separate instances**.

---

## 🔧 Code-Based Example

```csharp
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _service1;
    private readonly IMyService _service2;

    public MyController(IMyService service1, IMyService service2)
    {
        _service1 = service1;
        _service2 = service2;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        bool same = ReferenceEquals(_service1, _service2);
        return Content("Same instance? " + same);
    }
}
```

### Using `AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>()`

* Output: **"Same instance? True"**
* Explanation: Because it's the same request, and Scoped lifetime **shares the same instance.**

### Using `AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>()`

* Output: **"Same instance? False"**
* Explanation: Two instances are created, one for each parameter.

---

## 🤔 When To Use Each?

### ✅ **Use Scoped** when:

* Your service uses **shared resources**, like `DbContext`, `HttpClientFactory`, etc.
* You want **consistency** during one HTTP request (e.g., DB transactions).
* Examples: **Repositories**, **business logic layers**, **providers**

### ✅ **Use Transient** when:

* The service is **lightweight** and has **no state** or dependencies on anything shared.
* You **don’t care** if multiple instances are created.
* Examples: **HTTP API proxies**, **mappers**, **validators**

## 🧩 Summary

| Feature                   | **Transient**                    | **Scoped**                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Created per request to DI | ✅ Yes                            | ✅ Yes, but once per **HTTP request**      |
| Reused within request?    | ❌ No – always new                | ✅ Yes – same object reused                |
| Good for?                 | Lightweight, stateless services  | Services needing shared state per request |
| Bad for?                  | DbContext, shared-state services | Caching across requests                   |
