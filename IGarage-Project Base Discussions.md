PRA (Project ‚Üí Role ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Result)
### **Interview-Ready iGarage Experience:**
At iGarage, I was the sole developer responsible for maintaining and optimizing a system that had entered maintenance mode. Although active feature development had stopped, I was fully in charge of keeping the system stable, secure, and efficient. That included monitoring system health, fixing bugs, improving performance, and handling production incidents.

Since the client had already decided to sunset the project eventually, I also took on the responsibility of preparing a smooth handover. That meant improving documentation, identifying technical risks, and working closely with other developers and teams who would eventually take over or archive the system. I made sure that when the transition happened, the team had everything they needed ‚Äî clean code, clear documentation, and a strong understanding of the system‚Äôs behavior.

Even though I was working solo, I stayed proactive ‚Äî identifying performance bottlenecks, refactoring legacy code, and reducing technical debt to keep the system in top shape. One example I‚Äôm proud of is improving response times by optimizing database queries and cleaning up some inefficient code paths.

This experience really strengthened my ability to work independently, take full ownership of a system, and communicate effectively with cross-functional teams. I also learned how to manage a transition phase ‚Äî making sure nothing breaks even as a project winds down.

Interview-Ready, Conversational Version: 
    
At iGarage, I was primarily responsible for maintaining and optimizing a system that had moved into maintenance mode. While we weren‚Äôt doing a lot of new feature development, my role was really focused on ensuring the system stayed stable, efficient, and reliable for the users.

I worked on a number of fronts ‚Äî from monitoring system health and handling incidents, to resolving bugs, refactoring legacy code, and optimizing performance. For example, I identified and fixed some key bottlenecks in the system, which helped reduce response times and improved user experience, especially during peak hours.‚Äù

Even though the project was stable, I didn‚Äôt just sit back ‚Äî I worked on reducing technical debt, updating documentation, and keeping the codebase clean so that if and when the system moved back into active development, it‚Äôd be easy to ramp up again.

It really sharpened my skills in troubleshooting, system thinking, and long-term maintenance. And it taught me that maintaining and strengthening existing systems can be just as impactful as building new ones.

## **Sentry SDK Set up in iGarage**
In our ASP.NET application, we initialized Sentry in Application_Start() using SentrySdk.Init. We provided the DSN key from the config file, enabled ASP.NET and Entity Framework integration, and set performance monitoring with TracesSampleRate = 1.0. When an exception occurs, the Sentry SDK automatically captures it ‚Äî along with context like stack trace, request data, and user environment ‚Äî and sends it to Sentry's server using an HTTP request. This happens in the background and helps us track issues in real time.
o.Dsn = ... ‚Äî This tells the SDK where to send the error data (Sentry server endpoint).
o.AddAspNet() ‚Äî Hooks into the ASP.NET pipeline to automatically capture unhandled exceptions.
o.AddEntityFramework() ‚Äî Captures database-related performance issues (if using EF).
o.Debug = true ‚Äî Shows SDK internal logs during development.
o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0 ‚Äî Enables performance monitoring (traces every request).

Interview Pitch Example:

I worked on a 6-month project called IGarage, which is an online platform that connects car owners with nearby repair services. It lets users book repairs, track service history, and find garages on a map ‚Äî all in one place.

The tech stack included ASP.NET MVC 5, Web API, SignalR for real-time updates, and we hosted the backend on AWS using RDS and CodePipeline for CI/CD. I was involved in building and maintaining the core APIs, integrating Sentry for error tracking, and ensuring stable performance during user booking and communication flows. It was a great experience working in the automotive domain and building something that solved real-world service issues

Great ‚Äî here's a simple and professional way to answer the question:

---

### ‚ùì**What were the biggest risks to stability, and how did you mitigate them in the I Garage project?**

**"One of the biggest risks to stability in the I Garage project was unhandled exceptions in production, especially during peak traffic. These could cause downtime or broken functionality for users. To mitigate this, we integrated Sentry for real-time error tracking. It helped us catch errors early, identify the root cause quickly, and prioritize fixes.**

**Another risk was related to database performance ‚Äî slow queries could lead to timeouts and user frustration. We used APM features in Sentry along with Entity Framework logging to monitor and optimize those queries.**

**We also implemented structured logging and health checks, so we could proactively monitor the system and react before users were affected."**

Would you like this reworded for an interview response, or added to documentation or a project report?


Sure! Here's a simple and conversational way to answer **"Can you describe one optimization and show before/after metrics?"** based on your IGarage project:

---

**"Yeah, one key optimization I worked on was improving the performance of the garage search feature. Initially, when users searched for garages, it was taking around 4‚Äì5 seconds to load results, especially if the location data was large. We realized the API was fetching too much data and wasn‚Äôt using indexes effectively in the database.**

**So, we optimized the SQL queries, added proper indexing to the location columns in AWS RDS, and also implemented pagination on the frontend to reduce the load. After that, the response time dropped to under 1.5 seconds, which made the search feel much snappier for users. It also reduced the database CPU usage by about 30% during peak times."**

---

Here‚Äôs a simple, conversational way to answer **‚ÄúHow did you identify performance bottlenecks?‚Äù** based on your IGarage project:

---

**"We used a mix of tools and observation to find performance bottlenecks. First, we monitored real-time performance using Sentry APM, which helped us spot slow API calls and unhandled exceptions. It showed us which endpoints were taking longer than expected.**

**We also looked at AWS RDS metrics like query execution time and CPU usage. In some cases, we added logging around specific parts of the code to see how long certain operations were taking. Once we found the slow parts‚Äîlike inefficient SQL queries or large data loads‚Äîwe worked on optimizing those areas."**
