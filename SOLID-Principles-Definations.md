Want a Simple Framework to Remember or Explain SOLID in interview?
1) What is it?
2) Why does it matter?
3) How have you used it?

What it is: 
SOLID principles are the five principles of object-oriented class design. These are the set of rules and best practices to follow while designing the class structure. 

Why it matters ‚Äì practical benefit
By applying solid principles developers can create code, which is easy to understand, maintain, and extend as well. 
These principles help in achieving modularity, flexibility, and scalability in systems, thereby leading to improved code quality or less risk of bugs being introduced in the system on modification.


S stands for single responsibility, which say that a class in c# should take part in single responsibility. 
In other words, there should be only one reason to change a particular class. 
By adhering to this principle, we ensure that a class remains concise, focused, and easy to understand. 
It promotes high cohesion and prevents classes from becoming bloated with unrelated responsibilities.

O in solid stands for the Open Close Principle, which say that the classes should be open for enhancements but closed for modifications. 
So, this principle encourages us to design classes in such a way that can be easily modified without disturbing the existing functionality.
By using abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces new functionalities can be added without altering the existing code base.
This reduces the chances of introducing new bugs while modifying and breaking existing functionality as well.

L in solid stands for the "lik-so-vis" substitution principle, which say that the object of the super classes would be easily replaceable with the objects of the child classes without breaking the overall application or functionality.
In other words, child classes should be able to be used as substitutes for their parent classes without causing any unexpected behavior or violating of the contract of the parent classes. 
Adhering to this principle promotes modularity, extensibility, and code reusability. 

I stands for interface segregation which say that classes should not be forced to implement the interfaces they don't require. 
It suggests interfaces to be fine-grained and precise instead of being large and monolithic. 
By having smaller and more specialized interfaces, classes need to be dependent on the interfaces which are relevant to them.
This principle helps in avoiding fat interfaces and prevents unnecessary dependencies between classes.  

D in solid stands for dependency inversion which means classes should not be instantiating other classes, which they require to achieve their functionality. 
Instead, there should be a container class, which should create objects of all the classes and inject whatever dependencies are required in whichever classes by itself.
So it should be the responsibility of the container to create the objects and inject them wherever required, instead of the classes being responsible to create the objects of other classes that they require so that is the D dependency injection in SOLID.






In one of the recent projects I worked on, I developed a component responsible for cleaning up company data as part of a GDPR compliance task. This component had to handle soft/hard deletion of users and companies, change ownership of related entities, generate reports, and send notifications ‚Äî all wrapped around a batch processing model.

Here‚Äôs a **telephonic interview script** in a **conversational tone**, explaining **SOLID principles** using your `CleanupCompanies` class as the central example. This script assumes you're the interviewee and you're talking to a technical interviewer:

---

### **Telephonic Interview Script: Explaining SOLID with Real-World Example**

---

**Interviewer:** Can you walk me through how you applied SOLID principles in a real project?

**You:** Sure! I recently worked on a component responsible for cleaning up company data, as part of a GDPR compliance initiative. The logic was quite involved‚Äîit needed to soft-delete and hard-delete company/user data, reassign ownership of related entities like dossiers and alerts, and generate & email reports‚Äîso applying SOLID really helped in managing this complexity.

Let me walk you through how each SOLID principle played a part in this:

---

### **S - Single Responsibility Principle**

**You:** Every class and interface in the cleanup module had one clear responsibility. For instance, the class `CleanupCompanies` coordinated the entire cleanup workflow, but the actual deletion was handled by specialized interfaces like `ICompanyCleanup` and `IUserCleanup`. Similarly, email sending was offloaded to `ICleanupNotification`, and report generation to `ICompanyStatusReportProvider`.

So rather than one class doing everything, I delegated each specific task to a dedicated component.

---

### **O - Open/Closed Principle**

**You:** The system is open for extension but closed for modification. For example, if I need to introduce a new type of ownership reassignment, I can just implement a new strategy and inject it through `IOwnershipChanger`, without touching the existing cleanup logic.

Similarly, new cleanup modes or report enhancements can be added without modifying the core orchestration logic in `CleanupCompanies`.

---

### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle**

**You:** All the dependencies like `_companyCleanup`, `_userCleanup`, or `_batchJobReportUploader` follow interface-based design. That means any class implementing those interfaces can be substituted without breaking `CleanupCompanies`.

For instance, during unit testing, I could plug in mock implementations of `IBatchJobManager` or `ICleanupProvider` and validate the workflow without relying on the actual service.

---

### **I - Interface Segregation Principle**

**You:** Rather than having one huge interface for everything cleanup-related, we broke them down into focused interfaces: `ICompanyCleanup`, `IUserCleanup`, `ICleanupNotification`, `IBatchJobManager`, and so on.

Each interface contains only what a specific client needs‚Äîso a class implementing `IUserCleanup` doesn‚Äôt have to worry about methods related to dossier or batch job reporting.

---

### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

**You:** All high-level modules (like `CleanupCompanies`) depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. Everything is injected via interfaces in the constructor, such as `_ownershipChanger`, `_batchJobRepository`, or `_cleanupProvider`.

This makes the codebase very flexible‚Äîit's easy to swap out implementations or mock dependencies for testing.

---

**Interviewer:** That‚Äôs a really clear breakdown. Can you give a metaphor to relate this to the real world?

**You:** Sure! Think of `CleanupCompanies` like an **event planner** for a company‚Äôs office move (say, moving to a new GDPR-compliant platform). The planner doesn‚Äôt carry boxes or write emails‚Äîthey just coordinate specialists:

* **Movers** (like `ICompanyCleanup`, `IUserCleanup`) handle packing and moving (deleting data),
* **IT staff** (`IOwnershipChanger`) transfer system ownership (like dossiers and alerts),
* **Admin** (`ICleanupNotification`) sends out relocation notices (emails),
* **Accountant** (`ICompanyStatusReportProvider`) generates financial reports (in our case, cleanup reports),
* And **file clerks** (`IBatchJobReportUploader`) archive all reports to the cloud.

Each role has a single, focused responsibility. And the planner doesn't care who exactly does the work‚Äîas long as they follow the contract (i.e., implement the right interface).

---

**Interviewer:** I love that analogy. So you‚Äôd say this approach helped with maintainability?

**You:** Absolutely. The moment requirements changed‚Äîsay, we needed a new cleanup report format or a different storage backend‚Äîwe could plug it in without rewriting the core logic. That‚Äôs the beauty of SOLID principles in practice.
