SOLID principles are the five principles of object-oriented class design. These are the set of rules and best practices to follow while designing the class structure. 

S stands for single responsibility, which say that a class in c# should take part in single responsibility. 
In other words, there should be only one reason to change a particular class. 
By adhering to this principle, we ensure that a class remains concise, focused, and easy to understand. 
It promotes high cohesion and prevents classes from becoming bloated with unrelated responsibilities.

O in solid stands for the Open Close Principle, which say that the classes should be open for enhancements but closed for modifications. 
So, this principle encourages us to design classes in such a way that can be easily modified without disturbing the existing functionality.
By using abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces new functionalities can be added without altering the existing code base.
This reduces the chances of introducing new bugs while modifying and breaking existing functionality as well.

L in solid stands for the "lik-so-vis" substitution principle, which say that the object of the super classes would be easily replaceable with the objects of the child classes without breaking the overall application or functionality.
In other words, child classes should be able to be used as substitutes for their parent classes without causing any unexpected behavior or violating of the contract of the parent classes. 
Adhering to this principle promotes modularity, extensibility, and code reusability. 

I stands for interface segregation which say that classes should not be forced to implement the interfaces they don't require. 
It suggests interfaces to be fine-grained and precise instead of being large and monolithic. 
By having smaller and more specialized interfaces, classes need to be dependent on the interfaces which are relevant to them.
This principle helps in avoiding fat interfaces and prevents unnecessary dependencies between classes.  

D in solid stands for dependency inversion which means classes should not be instantiating other classes, which they require to achieve their functionality. 
Instead, there should be a container class, which should create objects of all the classes and inject whatever dependencies are required in whichever classes by itself.
So it should be the responsibility of the container to create the objects and inject them wherever required, instead of the classes being responsible to create the objects of other classes that they require so that is the D dependency injection in SOLID.

By applying solid principles developers can create code, which is easy to understand, maintain, and extend as well. 
These principles help in achieving modularity, flexibility, and scalability in systems, thereby leading to improved code quality or less risk of bugs being introduced in the system on modification.

Your script is already solid (pun intended) in terms of content! It‚Äôs detailed, technically correct, and shows a strong grasp of the SOLID principles ‚Äî especially in the context of C# and object-oriented design.

However, for a telephonic interview, you want to tweak your delivery a bit so it sounds more like a conversation than a lecture or blog post. Recruiters or interviewers on the phone don‚Äôt have visual aids, so we need to make the tone friendly, the pace smooth, and the explanations clear but not too dense.

## üéôÔ∏è Here's how to turn **your script** into a **telephonic-friendly version**:

### üîπ **Start with a short intro (sets the tone):**

> ‚ÄúSure, I'd be happy to explain the SOLID principles.  
These are five best practices in object-oriented design that help us build scalable and maintainable systems. I‚Äôve applied them mostly in C#, but they apply across many languages and even in frameworks like Angular. I‚Äôll walk through each one briefly.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ **S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

> ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòS‚Äô stands for *Single Responsibility*.  
It means that a class should only do **one thing**‚Äîand have **one reason to change**.  
For example, in C#, if I have a `UserManager` class, it should just manage users‚Äînot handle logging or email sending.  
Keeping responsibilities separate makes the code easier to read, test, and maintain.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ **O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle**

> ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòO‚Äô is *Open/Closed*.  
It means a class should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.  
So if I want to add new behavior, I shouldn‚Äôt have to change the existing class‚ÄîI can just **extend** it.  
For example, using interfaces or inheritance, I can add a new payment method to a billing system without touching the original code.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ **L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle**

> ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòL‚Äô is *Liskov Substitution*, which says that subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes **without breaking the app**.  
A classic example: if `Bird` has a `fly()` method, a subclass like `Eagle` should be able to fly too. But if I make an `Ostrich` subclass and it throws an error when `fly()` is called, it violates this principle.  
So, child classes should behave in a way that‚Äôs consistent with their parent class expectations.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ **I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle**

> ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòI‚Äô is *Interface Segregation*.  
It says we shouldn‚Äôt force a class to implement methods it doesn‚Äôt need.  
So instead of one big `IMachine` interface with `Print()`, `Scan()`, and `Fax()`, it‚Äôs better to break it into smaller interfaces like `IPrinter`, `IScanner`, and so on.  
That way, a simple printer class doesn‚Äôt need to implement `Fax()` if it doesn‚Äôt support it.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ **D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle**

> ‚ÄúAnd finally, the ‚ÄòD‚Äô is *Dependency Inversion*.  
This says that high-level modules shouldn‚Äôt depend on low-level ones. Instead, **both should depend on abstractions**.  
In real projects, this means I avoid using `new` to create dependencies inside classes.  
Instead, I rely on something like dependency injection. In C#, we typically use an IoC container to create objects and inject them where needed.  
That way, components are loosely coupled, and it's easier to swap implementations, especially for testing.‚Äù

---

### üßæ **Wrap-up (keep it short and strong):**

> ‚ÄúSo in short, SOLID helps keep code **modular, testable, and maintainable**.  
It reduces the risk of bugs when we make changes and makes large systems easier to scale.  
I've seen these principles really pay off in long-term projects where change is constant.‚Äù

---

## üí¨ Optional: If they ask, *‚ÄúHow do you apply this in Angular?‚Äù*

> ‚ÄúEven though Angular is more component-based than traditional OOP, I still apply SOLID concepts.  
For example, I keep components focused (SRP), use services and interfaces for abstraction (OCP & DIP), and keep form logic or API logic out of the view layer.  
Angular‚Äôs dependency injection system makes it easy to follow these principles.‚Äù

In one of the recent projects I worked on, I developed a component responsible for cleaning up company data as part of a GDPR compliance task. This component had to handle soft/hard deletion of users and companies, change ownership of related entities, generate reports, and send notifications ‚Äî all wrapped around a batch processing model.
