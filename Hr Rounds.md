#Tell me something about yourself
---
First of all, thank you for this opportunity. I am Amit Gupta, and I bring over 16 years of experience in web development. 

Most recently, I worked at Nintec Solution Limited in Ahmedabad as a Senior Analyst Software Developer.

My background includes working with programming languages like VB.NET, C#, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on full-stack development.
 
I've had the chance to contribute to a wide range of projects—from large-scale enterprise applications to lightweight console utilities.

Over the years, I’ve also led development teams and collaborated closely with cross-functional groups to deliver high-quality solution on-time and with in budget.

I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, solving real-world problems, and constantly learning. 

I enjoy mentoring junior developers and keeping up with the latest trends & technologies so I can bring modern solutions to the table.

In short, I’m a developer who brings experience, leadership, and a love for continuous improvement to every team I join.
