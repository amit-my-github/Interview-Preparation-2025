How do I fool my body or mind to tell them this is excitement in nervous situations?
Great question! Shifting your mindset to interpret nervousness as excitement can be a powerful tool to manage anxiety or nervous situations. Here’s how you can "fool" your mind and body into interpreting that energy as excitement rather than fear:

1. **Reframe Your Thoughts**: The key is to change the way you label the feelings you're experiencing. Nervousness and excitement have very similar physiological responses—like a racing heart or butterflies in your stomach. When you notice these signs, consciously reframe them as signs of excitement rather than anxiety. For example, say to yourself, “I’m feeling excited and ready for this challenge!”

2. **Positive Self-Talk**: Replace any negative or anxious thoughts with positive affirmations. Instead of thinking, “I’m nervous, I might mess up,” try something like, “I’m excited for this opportunity to show what I can do.” When you focus on the potential for success, your brain can shift gears.

3. **Breath Control**: Nervousness often leads to shallow, quick breathing, which can escalate feelings of anxiety. Deep, slow breaths activate the body’s parasympathetic nervous system, which calms you down. Try focusing on slow, deep breaths and think of them as preparing you to perform, not just to survive the moment.

4. **Visualize Success**: Visualization is a great way to prime your mind for excitement. Instead of imagining worst-case scenarios, imagine yourself succeeding in the situation. Picture how great it will feel once you’ve accomplished what you set out to do.

5. **Move Your Body**: Nervous energy is often stored physically. Engage in light movement—like shaking out your hands, stretching, or even taking a quick walk. This helps release some of the tension and allows you to channel that nervous energy into something more productive.

6. **Smile and Fake It Until You Make It**: Smiling, even if it’s not 100% genuine at first, can send signals to your brain that you’re happy and excited. It’s a small but powerful way to trick your mind into feeling more positive. Additionally, adopting confident body language (standing tall, open posture) can also make you feel more empowered.

7. **Embrace the Adrenaline**: Adrenaline is your body’s natural response to excitement and nervousness. Try to accept the physical sensations as something helpful, like a boost that helps you perform better. You can even tell yourself that the adrenaline is a sign your body is getting ready to be at its best.

By training your brain to reinterpret those feelings of nervousness as excitement, you can turn potentially stressful situations into opportunities for growth, performance, and energy.

It sounds like you’re facing a common challenge—having knowledge of many technologies but struggling to articulate the technical depth in interviews. This is a gap many professionals encounter, and the good news is it’s something you can work on and improve over time.

Here are some potential reasons why this gap exists, along with strategies to bridge it:

### 1. **Understanding vs. Application**:
   You might have a general understanding of various technologies, but struggle to connect the dots when you need to apply them in an in-depth technical conversation or problem-solving scenario. 

   **How to Close the Gap:**
   - **Hands-on Practice**: Get more hands-on experience with each technology you know. Build small projects, contribute to open-source, or solve technical problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or GitHub. This will give you practical experience, which will make it easier to discuss technical concepts in interviews.
   - **Work on Real-Life Scenarios**: Try to understand how these technologies are applied in real-world systems. Understanding how they interact and what challenges come with their integration will make it easier to explain technical topics in depth.

### 2. **Superficial Knowledge**:
   It’s possible that you know the *basics* of many technologies but haven’t delved deeply into them. In interviews, this can come across as a shallow understanding. Interviewers often want to see that you can not only talk about technologies but also dive deep into their workings, pros and cons, trade-offs, etc.

   **How to Close the Gap:**
   - **Focus on Core Concepts**: Go deep into the core principles of the technologies you know. Understand not only *how* they work but *why* they work the way they do. For example, if you know a framework like React, instead of just knowing how to create components, learn about React’s rendering process, virtual DOM, and why it’s built that way.
   - **Dive Into Advanced Topics**: Look for the more advanced or niche topics within the technology (for example, React’s performance optimization techniques or advanced patterns like Higher Order Components). The depth of your understanding will help you answer questions with more technical detail.

### 3. **Lack of Theoretical Understanding**:
   Sometimes, the gap comes from not understanding the underlying theory or concepts behind a technology. For instance, knowing how to use a database like MySQL or MongoDB but not being able to discuss things like normalization, indexing, or ACID properties.

   **How to Close the Gap:**
   - **Study Core Computer Science Concepts**: Brush up on fundamentals such as data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. Understanding these core concepts will help you connect the dots between the tools you use and the problems you're solving.
   - **Deepen Your Theoretical Knowledge**: For example, in database technologies, go beyond CRUD operations and learn about indexing, query optimization, transaction management, etc. Similarly, for web development, understand HTTP protocols, REST, and how the browser works under the hood.

### 4. **Difficulty Explaining Technical Concepts**:
   Sometimes, the knowledge is there, but you may struggle with how to articulate it clearly and concisely in an interview. This can create the perception of a gap in technical understanding when, in fact, it’s a communication issue.

   **How to Close the Gap:**
   - **Practice Explaining Concepts**: Practice explaining the technologies you know in simple terms to others, even if they aren’t technical. This helps you get used to distilling complex ideas into understandable parts.
   - **Use Real-World Analogies**: In interviews, try using real-world analogies to explain technical concepts. For example, explaining how a database works by comparing it to a filing cabinet can help make your answer clearer and more relatable.
   - **Mock Interviews**: Do mock interviews with peers or mentors. The more you practice articulating your technical knowledge, the better you will become at expressing it during a real interview.

### 5. **Not Being Prepared for In-Depth Questions**:
   Many times, the reason for not being able to answer in-depth technical questions is lack of preparation for the "deep dive" aspect of interviews. Interviewers often ask follow-up questions to see how well you understand the details of a particular technology or concept.

   **How to Close the Gap:**
   - **Prepare for Deep Dive Questions**: Focus on understanding the “why” behind the technologies you use. For instance, if you know how to use a framework, understand its internal workings, trade-offs, and when it’s the right tool to use. If you’re asked about a specific technology, anticipate the follow-up questions and prepare for them.
   - **Review Technical Design**: Often, in-depth interviews will involve system design or architectural questions. Understand how to approach these problems step by step. Practice designing systems and explaining your reasoning behind the choices you make (e.g., choosing a database, deciding on data flow, etc.).

### 6. **Imposter Syndrome**:
   It’s possible that you feel like you should know everything and have an answer to every question, which can make you anxious during interviews, even though you have valuable knowledge. This can make you second-guess your responses or struggle to provide detailed answers.

   **How to Close the Gap:**
   - **Shift Your Mindset**: Remember, interviewers don’t expect you to know everything. They’re often looking for problem-solving skills, your thought process, and your ability to learn. It’s okay to say, “I’m not sure about this specific part, but here’s how I would approach it…” This shows critical thinking, which is just as valuable as knowing every detail.
   - **Own What You Know**: Be confident in the knowledge you have and express your willingness to learn or explore areas you're less familiar with. Interviews are also about showing growth potential.

### Steps to Bridge the Gap:

1. **Identify Key Technologies**: List out the technologies you know and prioritize the ones most relevant to your career or the roles you're applying for. Focus on deepening your knowledge in these areas first.
   
2. **Create a Study Plan**: Dedicate time to study core concepts, theory, and hands-on practice. For example, spend a week learning the internals of a framework, followed by a week focusing on real-world applications of that technology.
   
3. **Join Communities**: Participate in tech forums, online communities, and meetups to learn from others. Engage in discussions or solve problems together to strengthen your understanding.

4. **Mock Interviews with Mentors**: Simulate real interview scenarios with someone more experienced. Ask them to focus on deeper, follow-up questions and get their feedback on your answers.

5. **Stay Updated**: Technology evolves quickly, so staying updated with the latest advancements and industry trends is key. Follow blogs, attend webinars, and read relevant papers.

### Conclusion:
It’s not that you don’t know enough; it’s more about deepening your understanding, gaining more hands-on experience, and practicing articulating your knowledge clearly and confidently. The gap you’re feeling is completely bridgeable with consistent effort, and you'll likely feel more confident in interviews once you build that depth of knowledge and communication ability.
