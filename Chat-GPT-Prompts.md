Acing Any Interview with ChatGPT in 7 Steps 👇

1. Assign a Persona

Purpose: Make ChatGPT act like your dream interviewer or mentor.

This simulates real-world scenarios and tailors the experience to a specific job and company.

Prompt Example:

> "Help me prepare for an HR round by generating 10 commonly asked questions and helping me craft STAR-format answers."



Precision leads to highly relevant answers that match your interview stage.


3. Set the Tone & Level

Purpose: Adjust difficulty and formality based on your target role or experience level.

Prompt Example:

> "Ask me intermediate-level Python interview questions in a serious tone, suitable for someone with 2 years of experience."



This avoids responses that are too basic or too advanced for your current level.


4. Break it Down by Rounds or Topics

Purpose: Divide interview prep into sections: Resume, HR, Tech, Case Studies, etc.
