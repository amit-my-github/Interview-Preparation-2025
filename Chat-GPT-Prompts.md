Acing Any Interview with ChatGPT in 7 Steps üëá

1. Assign a Persona

Purpose: Make ChatGPT act like your dream interviewer or mentor.

Prompt Example:

> "Act as a hiring manager at Google for a data analyst role. Ask me typical technical and behavioral interview questions and evaluate my responses."



This simulates real-world scenarios and tailors the experience to a specific job and company.


2. Define Your Objective

Purpose: Set clear goals (mock interview, answer review, question bank creation, etc.)

Prompt Example:

> "Help me prepare for an HR round by generating 10 commonly asked questions and helping me craft STAR-format answers."



Precision leads to highly relevant answers that match your interview stage.


3. Set the Tone & Level

Purpose: Adjust difficulty and formality based on your target role or experience level.

Prompt Example:

> "Ask me intermediate-level Python interview questions in a serious tone, suitable for someone with 2 years of experience."



This avoids responses that are too basic or too advanced for your current level.


4. Break it Down by Rounds or Topics

Purpose: Divide interview prep into sections: Resume, HR, Tech, Case Studies, etc.

Prompt Example:

> "Give me a list of SQL-related scenario-based interview questions and then test me one-by-one like a quiz."



You can focus on one area at a time and simulate the actual interview structure.


5. Set Format and Time Limits

Purpose: Practice under realistic constraints to boost time management.

Prompt Example:

> "Give me a behavioral question. I‚Äôll answer, and you give feedback on structure, clarity, and duration (keep it under 2 minutes)."



Mimics real interviews, where time and clarity are key.


6. Provide Background or Context

Purpose: Share your resume, experience, or job role so the advice is customized.

Prompt Example:

> "I have 3 years of experience in data analytics, strong in Excel and SQL, applying for a hybrid role. What kinds of questions should I expect?"


ChatGPT tailors preparation to your actual strengths and gaps.


7. Refine and Iterate

Purpose: Improve your responses with feedback and polishing.

Prompt Example:

> "Here‚Äôs my answer to 'Tell me about yourself.' Suggest edits to make it more impactful and less generic."


Feedback loops help you perfect delivery, language, and confidence.

In LegalIntelligence project, we followed a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to build modular and reusable services. 
To implement this, we used Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) as our core service framework. 
Each service was designed as an independent component, deployed via Windows Services, and exposed through WCF endpoints. 
This helped us maintain loose coupling, reuse services across multiple modules, and scale specific parts of the system without impacting the whole.
The front end was built using ASP.NET MVC for rendering views and handling user interactions.
Instead of having the presentation layer talk directly to the business logic or database,
We used a service proxy layer to abstract communication with our self-hosted Web API, which was built using OWIN. 
As a result, the business logic stayed clean, testable, and resilient to changes in the API layer.
Our business layer resided on the application server and was responsible for implementing all core logic. 
It communicated with the database using Entity Framework, following the Repository and Unit of Work patterns to ensure clean separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
This design allowed us to scale horizontally, keep each layer independently deployable and testable, and enforce domain boundaries. It also simplified onboarding and debugging, since each layer had a specific responsibility.
In addition to structured data, we also needed high-performance search functionality. For that, we integrated Apache Solr, which we accessed through a custom-built Solr client library. This allowed us to perform full-text search, faceted filtering, and dynamic sorting ‚Äî features that would be inefficient in a traditional relational database.
So this is all about the overview of architecture of LI project
