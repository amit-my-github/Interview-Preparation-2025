These prompts will help me understand the structure and depth you're looking for in the response, whether you're asking for an explanation, a structured interview answer, or a deeper dive into a specific topic. The more specific you are about your needs, the better I can tailor the answer!

Feel free to experiment with these prompts for any topic, and I'll follow a similar structure to what we've done here. Would you like to practice another topic?
