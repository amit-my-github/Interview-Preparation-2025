Thanks for sharing your detailed tech stack and experience. Based on what you've written, it sounds like you're feeling frustrated and concerned that your technical rounds aren't going well despite having over 16 years of experience. Let‚Äôs break this down and try to pinpoint **why you might be struggling in technical interviews** and what can be done to turn things around.

---

### ‚úÖ **Strengths from Your Stack (Real & Solid)**

Your experience seems real and grounded in enterprise application development:

* **Back-End:** Strong .NET expertise (C#, ASP.NET MVC/Core, Web API, WCF)
* **Front-End:** Hands-on with Angular, KnockoutJS, jQuery (though more legacy)
* **DevOps & CI/CD:** Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy ‚Äì very relevant
* **Database:** SQL Server experience (2005‚Äì2019) + AWS RDS
* **Testing & Quality:** Rhino Mocks, Moq, FxCop, SonarQube ‚Äì often overlooked but important
* **Cloud Exposure:** AWS (even if not deep, it‚Äôs a good base)
* **SSO & Enterprise:** Ping Identity and StructureMap are common in big, legacy systems

### ‚ùå **Possible Reasons Why You're Not Cracking Interviews**

#### 1. **Too Broad, Not Deep in Any One Area**

Your stack is broad but seems like you may not be specializing in one area (e.g., modern front-end, deep AWS, microservices architecture, etc.). Many companies today are looking for **depth in one area** (e.g., expert-level ASP.NET Core + AWS + microservices or Angular + TypeScript + state management).

#### 2. **Lack of Recent Tools/Frameworks**

* Angular (you listed it, but which version?) ‚Üí If you‚Äôre not up-to-date with Angular 13+, RxJS, NGRX, etc., you might be seen as outdated.
* KnockoutJS and jQuery are legacy and rarely seen in newer projects.
* No mention of .NET 6/7/8 ‚Äî people are moving away from older .NET Framework/WCF.
* No Docker, Kubernetes ‚Äì increasingly expected in cloud-native interviews.
* No React or Vue ‚Äì if full-stack is expected, employers often want modern JS frameworks.

#### 3. **Algorithm/Data Structure Weakness**

* Many mid/senior interviews still include LeetCode-style DSA questions.
* If you've mostly done enterprise CRUD apps, you might not have practiced these.

#### 4. **System Design Experience Missing**

* After 10+ years, interviewers expect you to:

  * Design scalable APIs
  * Choose between REST vs GraphQL
  * Decide on microservices vs monolith
  * Use message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
  * Know CAP theorem, consistency, retries, retries

#### 5. **Communication / Interview Strategy**

* Are you showcasing **why** you chose a tech stack?
* Are you discussing **trade-offs**?
* Do you lead your answers with **impact** (e.g., ‚ÄúOptimized an API and reduced response time by 40%‚Äù)?

### üí° What You Can Do (Practical Steps)

#### üîÅ Modernize & Sharpen Skills

* **ASP.NET Core 6+**, focus on:

  * Minimal APIs
  * Middleware, DI
  * Logging and observability
* **Angular 15+** or consider learning **React**
* **AWS Deeper Dive:**

  * Focus on EC2, ECS/EKS, IAM, Lambda, API Gateway
* **Docker, Kubernetes:** Even basic knowledge helps
* **GitHub Actions** or **Terraform** ‚Äì very hot in DevOps-heavy teams

#### üìö Study for Interviews

* **DSA Practice (Optional but Useful):**

  * Leetcode ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù and ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù level (1-2 per day)
  * Focus on HashMap, Arrays, Recursion, Trees, and Dynamic Programming
* **System Design Prep:**

  * YouTube: Gaurav Sen, System Design Primer (GitHub)
  * Practice designing REST APIs with real constraints

#### üí¨ Practice Interviewing

* Mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io, or peers)
* Record yourself explaining architecture/design patterns
* Practice STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

#### üõ†Ô∏è Update Your Resume/LinkedIn

* Focus on achievements, not duties.
* ‚ÄúImproved deployment pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, reducing downtime by 30%‚Äù
* Highlight recent technologies upfront

### ü§î Final Thoughts

You *do not* have a fake profile based on your experience. But tech has moved *fast* in the past 5‚Äì6 years, and interview expectations are shifting towards:

* Modern stacks
* Cloud-native thinking
* Strong DSA & system design (even for seniors)

With 16+ years of experience, your value is **delivery, leadership, architecture, and debugging tough issues.** If you're not showcasing that, you're selling yourself short.
