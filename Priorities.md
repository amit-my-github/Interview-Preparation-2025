Thatâ€™s a completely valid concern, Amit! **Too many things at once can feel overwhelming.** Letâ€™s simplify this and create a structured approach so you can make steady progress. ðŸš€

## **ðŸŽ¯ What Should Be Your Priorities (In the Right Order)?**  
Think of this as a **step-by-step plan**, rather than trying to do everything at once.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Resume & LinkedIn Update (2 Weeks) â†’ Immediate Priority**
âœ” Your resume and LinkedIn profile should clearly **highlight your skills, experience, and achievements**.  
âœ” Recruiters first look at your profileâ€”**if it's weak, you wonâ€™t even get interviews**.  
âœ” I can help **optimize** your resume with the right keywords, structure, and impact.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Interview Preparation (Ongoing, Parallel to Job Search)**
âœ” Since expressing your skills in interviews is a challenge, **mock interviews & practice** are key.  
âœ” Focus on **common interview questions** for .NET, AWS, system design, and behavioral questions.  
âœ” Practice **how to "sell" your skills confidently**â€”this will help you negotiate better salaries.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Job Search & Applying (Once Resume Is Ready, Start Immediately)**
âœ” Start applying as soon as your resume & LinkedIn are updated.  
âœ” Donâ€™t wait for **perfect preparation**â€”you will improve as you go.  
âœ” Use **referrals** and **networking** instead of just applying randomly.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: AWS Certification (Parallel to Job Search, 1-2 Months)**
âœ” Since you already have **some AWS knowledge**, focus on structured study & practice tests.  
âœ” Certification **isnâ€™t mandatory for getting a job**, but it strengthens your profile.  
âœ” **Study while applying/interviewing**, so you donâ€™t delay job search.

## **ðŸ“Œ So, Your Focus Should Be:**
âœ… **Week 1-2:** Update Resume & LinkedIn  
âœ… **Week 3+ (Ongoing):** Start Job Search & Interview Practice  
âœ… **Parallel:** Study for AWS Certification (1-2 hours daily)
