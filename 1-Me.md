## **You typical day to day activities**

Typically, my day starts with a quick check of my official emails to ensure I don't miss any urgent updates or requests. Then, I attend our daily stand-up meeting where I share my progress, discuss any blockers I'm facing, and coordinate with the team. If there’s any issue, I usually speak with a senior team member to get it resolved quickly.

Throughout the day, I focus on my assigned development tasks. Sometimes, I also have pair programming sessions with junior team members to guide or support them. Once a task is complete, I push the code to the development branch. If there are any code reviews assigned to me, I prioritize those as well. Additionally, we have weekly meetings with the client or stakeholders to share updates and gather feedback.

Your covered activities:
Checking emails for urgent updates
Daily stand-up participation
Progress sharing and blocker discussion
Collaboration with seniors
Assigned development work
Pair programming with juniors
Code commits (to dev branch)
Code reviews
Weekly meetings with clients/stakeholders
Documentation – “I also document key changes or decisions related to my tasks.”
Testing – “Before pushing code, I ensure proper unit or integration testing is in place.”
Task tracking tools – “I regularly update task statuses on Jira (or any tool you use).”

🔄 Possible additions (optional):
If any of these apply to your role, you could mention them briefly:

### ✅ **What they’re evaluating:**

1. **Your role clarity** – Do you understand your responsibilities?
2. **Work habits & discipline** – Are you organized and proactive?
3. **Team collaboration** – Do you communicate well and support others?
4. **Problem-solving** – What do you do when you hit a roadblock?
5. **Technical engagement** – Are you hands-on with development, testing, code reviews?
6. **Ownership** – Do you follow through on your tasks and take accountability?
7. **Communication skills** – Can you explain technical work clearly?

### 🔁 Follow-up questions they might ask:

Depending on your answer, they might ask:

#### 🔧 Technical process:

* “Can you walk me through your development process from picking a task to deploying it?”
* “How do you ensure code quality before pushing to dev?”
* “What kind of tools do you use for task tracking or code collaboration?”

#### 🤝 Team collaboration:

* “Tell me about a time when you helped a junior teammate solve a problem.”
* “How do you handle conflicts or differing opinions during code reviews?”

#### 🚧 Problem-solving:

* “Can you give an example of a recent blocker and how you resolved it?”
* “What do you do if a senior isn’t available when you face an issue?”

#### 📊 Communication/client interactions:

* “What kind of updates do you typically share in client meetings?”
* “Have you ever had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder?”

### ✅ Tip for you:

After describing your day, be ready to expand on **one or two parts**—ideally with a quick example or tool you use. That shows both depth and experience.


Let me know if you want to practice answering any of these follow-ups!


Absolutely! Here's a professional, conversational, and simple way to answer all these common interview questions—each designed to reflect your experience and mindset clearly, without over-polishing or sounding scripted.

### 🔧 **Technical Process**

**Q: Can you walk me through your development process from picking a task to deploying it?**
**A:**
"Sure. Once a task is assigned, I start by understanding the requirements clearly. If anything is unclear, I clarify it with the BA or tech lead. I then break the task into smaller steps and plan how to approach it. After development, I write unit tests and test the functionality locally. Once everything looks good, I push the code to the dev branch and raise a merge request for code review. After review and approval, the code is moved to QA or staging for further testing, and finally deployed based on the release plan."

---

**Q: How do you ensure code quality before pushing to dev?**
**A:**
"I follow clean code practices, use meaningful naming, and make sure my logic is easy to understand. I test my changes thoroughly and write unit tests if required. Before pushing, I double-check the functionality, format the code using our standard tools, and make sure I haven’t missed any edge cases."

---

**Q: What kind of tools do you use for task tracking or code collaboration?**
**A:**
"We use tools like Jira for task tracking and sprint planning. For code collaboration, we use Git with GitLab or GitHub for version control, code reviews, and merge requests. We also use Confluence for documentation and Slack or Teams for communication."

---

### 🤝 **Team Collaboration**

**Q: Tell me about a time when you helped a junior teammate solve a problem.**
**A:**
"One of our junior developers was struggling with a bug that kept breaking the layout on different screen sizes. I sat with them in a pair programming session, walked through the code, and explained how the CSS and responsive logic could be improved. Instead of just giving the fix, I explained why it was happening, so they could learn. After that, they were able to apply similar fixes on their own in future tasks."

---

**Q: How do you handle conflicts or differing opinions during code reviews?**
**A:**
"I always try to keep code reviews focused on the code, not the person. If I disagree with a suggestion or receive critical feedback, I try to understand the reasoning first. I might ask for clarification or share my point of view respectfully. If we still don’t agree, we involve a senior team member or follow the team’s coding standards to reach a decision."

---

### 🚧 **Problem-Solving**

**Q: Can you give an example of a recent blocker and how you resolved it?**
**A:**
"Recently, I was working on an integration task, but the third-party API we were using kept failing in some cases without clear errors. I logged the responses, did some testing with different payloads, and documented the issue. Then I reached out to the API support team and also discussed it with our architect to look for alternatives. Once we identified the issue was on the provider’s side, we implemented a workaround and continued the development without delay."

---

**Q: What do you do if a senior isn’t available when you face an issue?**
**A:**
"If a senior isn't available, I first try to debug the issue myself by checking logs, error messages, or documentation. I also look for similar issues in past tickets or online resources. If I still can’t find a solution, I post the problem with details in the team chat so others can respond when they're free. That way, I don’t stay blocked, and I make progress as far as I can."

---

### 📊 **Communication / Client Interaction**

**Q: What kind of updates do you typically share in client meetings?**
**A:**
"In client meetings, we usually share progress updates, completed features, any issues or risks, and the plan for the next sprint. If there are any blockers from the client side, we also raise them. I try to keep my updates clear and focused on the impact to the business or timelines."

---

**Q: Have you ever had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder?**
**A:**
"Yes, many times. For example, when we had to delay a feature because of a technical dependency, I explained it by comparing it to a construction project—like needing the foundation ready before building the walls. I avoid using too many technical terms and instead relate it to something they can easily understand. That helps build trust and keeps communication smooth."
